# Something Recipes
Something Recipes is a React based website, with the intention to create and store your own recipes in an API - allowing you to rid of your stash of crudely jotted down index cards!

As our second project at General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive (SEI) course, our task was to implement the use of our own mock API, a third party API, React and Router. While our mock API holds our custom recipes, the third party API, thanks to [Spoonacular](https://spoonacular.com/), pairs our dishes with a wine suggestion.
